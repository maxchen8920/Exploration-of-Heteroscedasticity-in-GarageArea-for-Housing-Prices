# Exploration-of-Heteroscedasticity-in-GarageArea-for-Housing-Prices

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook aims to explore the effects of heteroscedasticity of independant variable 'GarageArea' on the robustness of regression models.
This exercise looks at the prediction of housing 'SalePrice' using only the single variable 'GarageArea'. The dataset is a modified version of the ["House Prices"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset from Kaggle.
